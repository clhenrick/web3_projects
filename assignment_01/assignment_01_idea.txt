My idea is to have fish that swim through water or roaches that scurry away depending on how the mouse moves.
With the roaches the mouse would create a light or glow that would make them run. With the fish
the mouse would create a shark or bigger fish that would make the fish swim away.  The user could
drop bait or food for the roaches or fish to swarm to.  This may be too complex but I would like to 
try to shoot for an idea that covers a similar concept of mouse interaction and objects reacting to it.
